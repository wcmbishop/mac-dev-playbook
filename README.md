# Mac Setup with Ansible

This repo provides an automated way to set up your Mac. It uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) to programmatically install software libraries and applications. The repo comes with some default install configuration, but you can also customize it to include the applications you care about.


## Requirements
The Ansible "playbook" we will use relies on a few things. Follow the install/setup steps below.

  1. Install Apple Xcode -- you can install Xcode from the Mac App Store.
  * Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) -- this is a popular Mac package manager. 
  * Install [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-pip).
  * Clone this repository to your local drive.
  * Accept the Xcode license agreement by running: `sudo xcodebuild -license accept`

> Note: If some Homebrew commands fail, you might need to agree to Xcode's license or fix some other Brew issue. Run `brew doctor` to see if this is the case.

## Configuring your playbook

This repo comes with the file `default.config.yml` -- this provides some default configuration, including a list of useful packages and applications. 

You can override any of the defaults configured in `default.config.yml` by creating a `config.yml` file. Here's an example config file which enables installation of Mac AppStore apps, Python (3), and R, and adds some specific Mac AppStore apps.

```
---
# enable (yes) or disable (no) certain software
configure_mac_app_store: yes
configure_python: yes
configure_rstats: yes

# Mac App Store (mas) applications
# NOTE: need to save your password in AppStore for free apps....
mas_installed_apps:
  - { id: 1333542190, name: "1Password" } 
  - { id: 409222199, name: "Cyberduck"}
  - { id: 441258766, name: "Magnet"}
  - { id: 1179623856, name: "Pastebot"}
mas_email: "your-email@internet.com"
mas_password: ""
```

Any variable you include in your config file will *replace* the default value -- e.g. if you wanted to add applications to the `brew` list, you can copy-paste the existing `homebrew_installed_packages` values from `default.config.yml` to `config.yml` and add more entries. 

#### Finding Apps

* **Brew packages**: To find brew packages to install, run the command `brew search <package-name>` and look for listings under "Formulae".
* **Brew applications**: brew installs applications using `brew cask` (an add-on). To find brew applications, run the command `brew search <app-name>` and look for listings under "Casks".
* **Mac AppStore**: Mac AppStore apps are installed using the `mas` package. To find application info, run the command `mas search <app-name>`. NOTE: you will need to run the ansible playbook once initially to install the `mas` package (or manually run `brew install mas`).

## Running the playbook

To run the Ansible playbook and install all the configured software, do the following in a command line app like `terminal`. This will prompt you for a sudo password to start.

1. Change into the playbook directory -- for example:  
	`$ cd ~/path/to/repo`
2. Run the playbook:  
	`$ ansible-playbook main-playbook.yml -i inventory -K`
 
Optionally, you can filter which set of processes to run by adding 1 or more "tags" to the playbook command. For example, the call below will just run the installation process for homebrew apps and python. The tags available are `homebrew`, `mas` (Mac AppStore), `rstats`, `python`.

	$ ansible-playbook main-playbook.yml -i inventory -K --tags "homebrew,python"
